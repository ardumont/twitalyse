***** TODO integration clojure/twitter/gae [0/1]
      WARN: blacklisted apis in appengine could pose problems
******* TODO ask the twitter-clojure guys if the lib is GAE compatible

***** TODO poc gae bigtable
      Note: we will need to use the GAE datastore (see iteration1)
      Using this api from clojure may not be trivial ...
*** TODO documentation [/]
***** TODO write how to deploy on appengine
*** TODO security: externalize the secret phrases 
    - If we add them each time in the src files, one day it will by
      pushed by error :)
    - should be in a var env, user home, or something
    - Loaded from a file which is in .gitignore
    
** TODO iteration 1 [0/2]
*** TODO (ugly page) Display the number of twitter tagged #sfeir of a hardcoded list of sfeir accounts. [0/4]
***** TODO content of the page
    - Display as a simple list, with 2 columns : 
      - twitter name
      - full person name
      - counter (what about the retweet ? Does it count as a tweet ? KISS!
        But should be indicated)
      - sorted by counter, then twitter name
    - count the tweets since the beginning of the Epoch
    - display a last updated ("last updated 3h ago")

***** TODO cache the result of the twitter request
      explaination : the twitter query takes a long time (even for one
      tweet!). 
      So we will need to cache it. It means using the GAE datastore ...

***** TODO look of the page [0/2]
      it would be nice to have a pretty html page (design *is* important)

******* TODO The sfeirien with the most #sfeir twit highlited (winner!)

******* TODO powered by logos (powered by clojure/gae/sfeir)
